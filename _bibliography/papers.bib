    Rates of missing data often depend on record-keeping policies and thus may change across times and locations, even when the underlying features are comparatively stable. In this paper, we introduce the problem of Domain Adaptation under Missingness Shift (DAMS). Here, (labeled) source data and (unlabeled) target data would be exchangeable but for different missing data mechanisms. We show that if missing data indicators are available, DAMS reduces to covariate shift. Addressing cases where such indicators are absent, we establish the following theoretical results for underreporting completely at random: (i) covariate shift is violated (adaptation is required); (ii) the optimal linear source predictor can perform arbitrarily worse on the target domain than always predicting the mean; (iii) the optimal target predictor can be identified, even when the missingness rates themselves are not; and (iv) for linear models, a simple analytic adjustment yields consistent estimates of the optimal target parameters. In experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data, we demonstrate the promise of our methods when assumptions hold. Finally, we discuss a rich family of future extensions.},

Machine learning (ML) models deployed in healthcare systems must face data drawn from continually evolving environments.
However, researchers proposing such models typically evaluate them in a time-agnostic manner, 
splitting datasets according to patients sampled randomly throughout the entire study time period. 
This work proposes the Evaluation on Medical Datasets Over Time (EMDOT) framework, 
which evaluates the performance of a model class across time. 
Inspired by the concept of backtesting, EMDOT simulates possible training procedures that 
practitioners might have been able to execute at each point in time and evaluates the resulting models on all future time points. 
Evaluating both linear and more complex models on six distinct medical data sources (tabular and imaging), 
we show how depending on the dataset, using all historical data may be ideal in many cases, 
whereas using a window of the most recent data could be advantageous in others. 
In datasets where models suffer from sudden degradations in performance, we investigate plausible explanations for these shocks. 
We release the EMDOT package to help facilitate further works in deployment-oriented evaluation over time.

    Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the United States’s case fatality rate (CFR) has plummeted. Using
national and Florida data, we unpack the drop in CFR between April and December 2020, accounting for such
confounders as expanded testing, age distribution shift, and detection-to-death lags. Guided by the insight that
treatment improvements in this period should correspond to decreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), and using a
block-bootstrapping procedure to quantify uncertainty, we find that although treatment improvements do not follow the
same trajectory in Florida and nationally (with Florida undergoing a comparatively severe second peak), by December,
significant improvements are observed both in Florida and nationally (at least 17\% and 55\% respectively). These
estimates paint a more realistic picture of improvements than the drop in aggregate CFR (70.8\%–91.1\%). We publish a
website where users can apply our analyses to selected demographics, regions, and dates of interest.

  Machine learning models for predicting antibiotic resistance could reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in urinary tract infection. Use of broad-spectrum, second-line antibiotics in treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) is increasing, likely due to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Kanjilal et al. applied a machine learning approach calibrated to local hospital electronic health record data to predict the probability of resistance to first- and second-line antibiotic therapies for uncomplicated UTI. The algorithm then recommended the least broad-spectrum antibiotic to which a given isolate was predicted nonresistant. Use of the pipeline reduced both broad-spectrum and ineffective antibiotic prescription for UTI in the patient cohort relative to clinicians, suggesting the clinical potential of the approach. Antibiotic resistance is a major cause of treatment failure and leads to increased use of broad-spectrum agents, which begets further resistance. This vicious cycle is epitomized by uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), which affects one in two women during their life and is associated with increasing antibiotic resistance and high rates of prescription for broad-spectrum second-line agents. To address this, we developed machine learning models to predict antibiotic susceptibility using electronic health record data and built a decision algorithm for recommending the narrowest possible antibiotic to which a specimen is susceptible. When applied to a test cohort of 3629 patients presenting between 2014 and 2016, the algorithm achieved a 67\% reduction in the use of second-line antibiotics relative to clinicians. At the same time, it reduced inappropriate antibiotic therapy, defined as the choice of a treatment to which a specimen is resistant, by 18\% relative to clinicians. For specimens where clinicians chose a second-line drug but the algorithm chose a first-line drug, 92\% (1066 of 1157) of decisions ended up being susceptible to the first-line drug. When clinicians chose an inappropriate first-line drug, the algorithm chose an appropriate first-line drug 47\% (183 of 392) of the time. Our machine learning decision algorithm provides antibiotic stewardship for a common infectious syndrome by maximizing reductions in broad-spectrum antibiotic use while maintaining optimal treatment outcomes. Further work is necessary to improve generalizability by training models in more diverse populations.

    We qualitatively and quantitatively compare saliency maps generated from state-of-the-art 
    deep learning chest X-ray classification models to radiologist eye gaze data. 
    We find that across several saliency methods, 
    correct predictions have saliency maps more similar to the corresponding eye gaze data than the same for incorrect predictions. 
    To incorporate eye gaze into the model training process, 
    we create DenseNet-Aug, a simple augmentation of DenseNet which performs comparably to the state-of-the-art. 
    Finally, we extract salient annotated regions for each label class, thereby characterizing model attribution at the dataset level. 
    While sample-level saliency maps visibly vary, these dataset-level regional comparisons indicate that across most class labels, 
    radiologist eye gaze, DenseNet, and DenseNet-Aug often identify similar salient regions.

  abstract = {
    In several medical decision-making problems, such as antibiotic prescription, laboratory testing can provide precise indications for how a patient will respond to different treatment options. This enables us to "fully observe" all potential treatment outcomes, but while present in historical data, these results are infeasible to produce in real-time at the point of the initial treatment decision. Moreover, treatment policies in these settings often need to trade off between multiple competing objectives, such as effectiveness of treatment and harmful side effects. We present, compare, and evaluate three approaches for learning individualized treatment policies in this setting: First, we consider two indirect approaches, which use predictive models of treatment response to construct policies optimal for different trade-offs between objectives. Second, we consider a direct approach that constructs such a set of policies without intermediate models of outcomes. Using a medical dataset of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) patients, we show that all approaches learn policies that achieve strictly better performance on all outcomes than clinicians, while also trading off between different objectives. We demonstrate additional benefits of the direct approach, including flexibly incorporating other goals such as deferral to physicians on simple cases.

    Causal discovery is a process of discovering
causal information from observed data. Previous work in the field has focused on discovering causal directions in two variables, with extra
effort on constructing assumptions for the data
distribution and proving identifiability. However
they lack flexibility in scaling up causal discovery for multiple variables and a systematic endto-end pipeline. We extend two existing work in
the literature (LiNGAM and PNL), and by integrating them with deep neural networks, we propose an end-to-end learning scheme for training
a model for causal discovery. We evaluate our
method on several real and simulated datasets.

  abstract = {
    Antibiotics are critical to modern medicine. 
    However, levels of resistance have been rising, 
    exacerbated by over-prescription and misuse of antibiotics. 
    One major reason for this inappropriate usage is that 
    doctors often must decide treatment without the results of microbiologic testing, 
    a setting known as the empiric treatment setting. 
    Thus, this work aims to provide clinical decision support through patient-specific predictions of resistance at the point of care. 
    Combining information from diagnoses, procedures, medications, clinicians' notes, 
    and other modalities present in electronic medical records, 
    various machine learning models such as logistic regression and decision trees are used to predict patients' 
    probabilities of resistance to various antibiotics. 
    The full dataset consists of electronic medical records from patients presenting to the 
    Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham and Women's Hospital between 2007 and 2016. 
    On samples from the urinary tract (UTIs), which comprise approximately 
    48\% of microbiology samples, 
    the models achieve test AUCs ranging from 0.665 to 0.955 (depending on the antibiotic). 
    To evaluate the practical utility of these models, we extract the uncomplicated UTI cohort. 
    Combining model predictions with well-defined treatment guidelines, 
    a decision algorithm is constructed to recommend antibiotic treatments. 
    For uncomplicated UTIs, the algorithm reduces test set prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics by about 
    6.6\%, while retaining similar levels of inappropriate antibiotic therapy.

      The rise in popularity and ubiquity of
Twitter has made sentiment analysis of
tweets an important and well-covered area
of research. However, the 140 character
limit imposed on tweets makes it hard to
use standard linguistic methods for sentiment classification. On the other hand,
what tweets lack in structure they make up
with sheer volume and rich metadata. This
metadata includes geolocation, temporal
and author information. We hypothesize
that sentiment is dependent on all these
contextual factors. Different locations,
times and authors have different emotional
valences. In this paper, we explored this
hypothesis by utilizing distant supervision
to collect millions of labelled tweets from
different locations, times and authors. We
used this data to analyse the variation of
tweet sentiments across different authors,
times and locations. Once we explored
and understood the relationship between
these variables and sentiment, we used a
Bayesian approach to combine these variables with more standard linguistic features such as n-grams to create a Twitter sentiment classifier. This combined
classifier outperforms the purely linguistic classifier, showing that integrating the
rich contextual information available on
Twitter into sentiment classification is a
promising direction of research.

    Large wireless networks often have difficulty handling situations in which many clients in close proximity join
the network in a short time. Performance can also degrade when serving clients that have different usage
patterns. We propose Fast-Fi, a system that seeks to maximize throughput for clients and provide a better
network experience. Fast-Fi employs traffic control mechanisms on both the client and access point (AP)
machines, helping clients to choose APs such that their usage is distributed optimally across in-range APs.
Additionally, it suggests nearby networks for users if no networks in-range can provide sufficient throughput.
Moreover, the system collects usage patterns from all access points into a centralized server database for
network administrators. This system is both distributed and scalable such that it can be used in networks even
larger than that at MIT. We show that this model improves upon the current MIT network in a variety of common
usage scenarios.
