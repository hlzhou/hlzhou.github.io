Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by [Prof. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/).
<!-- Previously, I obtained my M.Eng. and Bachelors degrees in computer science and electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT). -->

<!-- My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare.  -->

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and healthcare. 
I am interested in developing **deployment-oriented** ML methods that are **useful**, **reliable**, and can
**detect** and **adapt** to distribution shifts that occur in healthcare over time. 
I have developed ML models for several data modalities, including time series, tabular data, images, and text, and am also interested in topics such as knowledge graphs and causality. 
I care deeply about 
grounding my work in 
impactful real-world problems, 
and 
have had the privilege of working with clinicians to devise ML solutions for various healthcare applications, including COVID-19 survival modeling and antibiotic risk prediction. 
<!-- that can learn from data collected over time, and  -->
<!-- More broadly, my goal is to build intelligent personal assistants for doctors and patients that are widely accessible and trusted. -->
<!-- 
I am interested in topics at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, such as <b>time series, multi-task learning, knowledge graphs, and causality</b>, with the goal of developing <b>personalized, accurate, and reliable</b> models to assist with clinical decision-making.</p> -->
<!-- I study how we can develop machine learning methods which can adapt to the ever-changing healthcare landscape.  -->
<!-- 
Throughout my career I hope to develop methods that will enable us to continually shine new light on parts of healthcare and medicine, such as autism, that are not yet well understood through classical means. -->

My work is generously supported by the [Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship](https://www.pdsoros.org/meet-the-fellows/helen-zhou) and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
Prior to CMU, I completed my masters of engineering (M.Eng.) degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), advised by [Prof. David Sontag](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/) 
<!-- in the [Clinical Machine Learning](http://clinicalml.org/) group. -->
and working with [Michael Oberst](https://www.michaelkoberst.com/) and [Prof. Sanjat Kanjilal](https://www.populationmedicine.org/skanjilal) in the [Clinical Machine Learning](http://clinicalml.org/) research group. 
In my undergraduate years at MIT, I researched at the MIT Media Lab with [Prof. Soroush Vosoughi](http://soroush.mit.edu/) and [Prof. Deb Roy](https://dkroy.media.mit.edu/) in the [Laboratory for Social Machines](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/social-machines/overview/), and collaborated with [Prof. Scott Greenwald](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/swgreen/overview/) and [Prof. Pattie Maes](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/pattie/overview/) in the [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/).
