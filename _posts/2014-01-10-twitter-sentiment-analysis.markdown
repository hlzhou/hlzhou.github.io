description: This was my first project with the MIT Media Lab's Laboratory for Social Machines (LSM), at the time known as the Cognitive Machines group. Over the semester and following summer, I created a tweet annotation website, and experimented with different features and classifiers. We ultimately found that a contextual classifier performed the best, and published in EMNLP 2015!
