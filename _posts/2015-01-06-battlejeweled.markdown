description: For an iOS mobile game development competition, we created a multiplayer make-3 (think Bejeweled or Candy Crush) game for Android, iOS, and even PC. Players can connect with each other and compete by making as many combos as they can. If the combos are complex enough, then it adds a twist to the other player's board! So that others can enjoy, we added it to the Android app store.
