description: Computer vision (6.819) was one of my favorite classes in junior year. For the final project, I worked with a classmate in the MIT Media Lab's Fluid Interfaces group to track eyes in low-cost virtual reality environments. This was not quite enough for practice use, however, so we forged on independently. Based on intuition I proposed and implemented a siamese convolutional neural network architecture instead, and gave a talk about it at the European Conference on Eye Movements last summer.
