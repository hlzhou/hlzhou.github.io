description: Last summer, I worked in Amazon Search's Digital Relevance team. My intern project was to universalize Kindle search results. Prior to my project, there were separate models for each country, and smaller countries had less data to go off of. The goal of my project was to create "one model to rule them all." After researching previous work in this problem of domain adaptation, throughout the summer I explored many possible variations of model types, features, and training objectives. Eventually, I arrived at a model that showed gains in multiple marketplaces! I learned a lot about model analysis and interpretation, and was excited about the impact I had on millions of Kindle customers. In the middle of the summer, there was also an intern hackathon. The night before, I was browsing Amazon and struggling to reconcile the diversity and abundance of available reviews. I had done a lot of previous work using natural language processing techniques, and proposed applying these methods to summarize reviews. Thus, my team and I created Summarize, a Google Chrome extension that summarized and grouped reviews by topics. We presented the prototype to the company, and they loved it! We won the hackathon, and with the encouragement of teams that reached out to us, we applied for a patent (currently under review). Last summer, I had a lot of fun using machine learning and natural language processing techniques in an industry research environment. I realized how impactful these methods could be, and I hope to continue to do more innovation in these fields.
