description: This semester, I am working in Professor David Sontag’s Clinical Machine Learning Group on antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is a major concern for humanity, and just this year, a woman died due to an infection resistant to all available antibiotics in the U.S.[4] When doctors prescribe patients with antibiotics, however, they often must do so before any lab reports come back about the patient’s resistance profile. The goal of my research is to develop a machine learning and statistical model for predicting antibiotic resistance. By reducing the chance that a doctor prescribes an antibiotic that the patient is already resistant to, we could make a difference in the life or death of the patient.
