description: After I complete my M.Eng. degree at MIT, I hope to continue research in machine learning and natural language processing, in a domain that helps people. I've really enjoyed digging deep into the technical questions that modern healthcare poses, and I am excited at the impact that machine learning techniques can have in this domain. Especially with the recent adoption of electronic medical records and abundance digital data about our lives, I believe that analyzing and making predictions using this data has the potential to significantly improve both our everyday lives and our general state of health.
